Over the last few weeks we fixed those issues, and now, after two release candidates, we are excited to finally release the stable version of React 15.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, <a href="/blog/2016/02/19/new-versioning-scheme.html">we’re switching to major versions</a> to indicate that we have been using React in production for a long time. This 15.0 release follows our previous 0.14 version and we’ll continue to follow semver like we’ve been doing since 2013. It’s also worth noting that <a href="/blog/2016/01/12/discontinuing-ie8-support.html">we no longer actively support Internet Explorer 8</a>. We believe React will work in its current form there but we will not be prioritizing any efforts to fix new issues that only affect IE8.</p>\n<p>React 15 brings significant improvements to how we interact with the DOM:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We are now using <code>document.createElement</code> instead of setting <code>innerHTML</code> when mounting components. This allows us to get rid of the <code>data-reactid</code> attribute on every node and make the DOM lighter. Using <code>document.createElement</code> is also faster in modern browsers and fixes a number of edge cases related to SVG elements and running multiple copies of React on the same page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Historically our support for SVG has been incomplete, and many tags and attributes were missing. We heard you, and in React 15 we <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6243">added support for all the SVG attributes that are recognized by today’s browsers</a>. If we missed any of the attributes you’d like to use, please <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1657">let us know</a>. As a bonus, thanks to using <code>document.createElement</code>, we no longer need to maintain a list of SVG tags, so any SVG tags that were previously unsupported should work just fine in React 15.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We received some amazing contributions from the community in this release, and we would like to highlight <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5753">this pull request</a> by <a href="https://github.com/mwiencek">Michael Wiencek</a> in particular. Thanks to Michael’s work, React 15 no longer emits extra <code>&#x3C;span></code> nodes around the text, making the DOM output much cleaner. This was a longstanding annoyance for React users so it’s exciting to accept this as an outside contribution.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While this isn’t directly related to the release, we understand that in order to receive more community contributions like Michael’s, we need to communicate our goals and priorities more openly, and review pull requests more decisively. As a first step towards this, we started publishing <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/core-notes">React core team weekly meeting notes</a> again. We also intend to introduce an RFC process inspired by <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs">Ember RFCs</a> so external contributors can have more insight and influence in the future development of React. We will keep you updated about this on our blog.</p>\n<p>We are also experimenting with a new changelog format in this post. Every change now links to the corresponding pull request and mentions the author.

We know changes can be painful (the Facebook codebase has over 20,000 React components, and that’s not even counting React Native), so we always try to make changes gradually in order to minimize the pain.</p>\n<p>If your code is free of warnings when running under React 0.14, upgrading should be easy. The bulk of changes in this release are actually behind the scenes, impacting the way that React interacts with the DOM. The other substantial change is that React now supports the full range of SVG elements and attributes. Beyond that we have a large number of incremental improvements and additional warnings aimed to aid developers. We’ve also laid some groundwork in the core to bring you some new capabilities in future releases.</p>\n<p>See the changelog below for more details.</p>\n<h2 id="installation"><a href="#installation" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Installation</h2>\n<p>We recommend using React from <code>npm</code> and using a tool like browserify or webpack to build your code into a single bundle. To install the two packages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>npm install --save react react-dom</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that by default, React runs extra checks and provides helpful warnings in development mode. When deploying your app, set the <code>NODE_ENV</code> environment variable to <code>production</code> to use the production build of React which does not include the development warnings and runs significantly faster.</p>\n<p>If you can’t use <code>npm</code> yet, we provide pre-built browser builds for your convenience, which are also available in the <code>react</code> package on bower.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>React</strong><br>\nDev build with warnings: <a href="https://fb.me/react-15.0.0.js">https://fb.me/react-15.0.0.js</a><br>\nMinified build for production: <a href="https://fb.me/react-15.0.0.min.js">https://fb.me/react-15.0.0.min.js</a>  </li>\n<li><strong>React with Add-Ons</strong><br>\nDev build with warnings: <a href="https://fb.me/react-with-addons-15.0.0.js">https://fb.me/react-with-addons-15.0.0.js</a><br>\nMinified build for production: <a href="https://fb.me/react-with-addons-15.0.0.min.js">https://fb.me/react-with-addons-15.0.0.min.js</a>  </li>\n<li><strong>React DOM</strong> (include React in the page before React DOM)<br>\nDev build with warnings: <a href="https://fb.me/react-dom-15.0.0.js">https://fb.me/react-dom-15.0.0.js</a><br>\nMinified build for production: <a href="https://fb.me/react-dom-15.0.0.min.js">https://fb.me/react-dom-15.0.0.min.js</a>  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="changelog"><a href="#changelog" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Changelog</h2>\n<h3 id="major-changes"><a href="#major-changes" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Major changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 id="documentcreateelement-is-in-and-data-reactid-is-out"><a href="#documentcreateelement-is-in-and-data-reactid-is-out" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a><code>document.createElement</code> is in and <code>data-reactid</code> is out</h4>\n<p>There were a number of large changes to our interactions with the DOM. One of the most noticeable changes is that we no longer set the <code>data-reactid</code> attribute for each DOM node. While this will make it more difficult to know if a website is using React, the advantage is that the DOM is much more lightweight. This change was made possible by us switching to use <code>document.createElement</code> on initial render. Previously we would generate a large string of HTML and then set <code>node.innerHTML</code>. At the time, this was decided to be faster than using <code>document.createElement</code> for the majority of cases and browsers that we supported. Browsers have continued to improve and so overwhelmingly this is no longer true. By using <code>createElement</code> we can make other parts of React faster. The ids were used to map back from events to the original React component, meaning we had to do a bunch of work on every event, even though we cached this data heavily. As we’ve all experienced, caching and in particularly invalidating caches, can be error prone and we saw many hard to reproduce issues over the years as a result. Now we can build up a direct mapping at render time since we already have a handle on the node.  </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>data-reactid</code> is still present for server-rendered content, however it is much smaller than before and is simply an auto-incrementing counter.  </p>\n<p><small><a href="https://github.com/sophiebits">@sophiebits</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5205">#5205</a></small></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4 id="no-more-extra-spans"><a href="#no-more-extra-spans" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>No more extra <code>&#x3C;span></code>s</h4>\n<p>Another big change with our DOM interaction is how we render text blocks. Previously you may have noticed that React rendered a lot of extra <code>&#x3C;span></code>s. For example, in our most basic example on the home page we render <code>&#x3C;div>Hello {this.props.name}&#x3C;/div></code>, resulting in markup that contained 2 <code>&#x3C;span></code>s. Now we’ll render plain text nodes interspersed with comment nodes that are used for demarcation. This gives us the same ability to update individual pieces of text, without creating extra nested nodes. Very few people have depended on the actual markup generated here so it’s likely you are not impacted. However if you were targeting these <code>&#x3C;span></code>s in your CSS, you will need to adjust accordingly. You can always render them explicitly in your components.  </p>\n<p><small><a href="https://github.com/mwiencek">@mwiencek</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5753">#5753</a></small></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4 id="rendering-null-now-uses-comment-nodes"><a href="#rendering-null-now-uses-comment-nodes" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Rendering <code>null</code> now uses comment nodes</h4>\n<p>We’ve also made use of these comment nodes to change what <code>null</code> renders to. Rendering to <code>null</code> was a feature we added in React 0.11 and was implemented by rendering <code>&#x3C;noscript></code> elements. By rendering to comment nodes now, there’s a chance some of your CSS will be targeting the wrong thing, specifically if you are making use of <code>:nth-child</code> selectors. React’s use of the <code>&#x3C;noscript></code> tag has always been considered an implementation detail of how React targets the DOM. We believe they are safe changes to make without going through a release with warnings detailing the subtle differences as they are details that should not be depended upon. Additionally, we have seen that these changes have improved React performance for many typical applications.  </p>\n<p><small><a href="https://github.com/sophiebits">@sophiebits</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5451">#5451</a></small></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4 id="functional-components-can-now-return-null-too"><a href="#functional-components-can-now-return-null-too" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Functional components can now return <code>null</code> too</h4>\n<p>We added support for <a href="/blog/2015/09/10/react-v0.14-rc1.html#stateless-function-components">defining stateless components as functions</a> in React 0.14. However, React 0.14 still allowed you to define a class component without extending <code>React.Component</code> or using <code>React.createClass()</code>, so <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5355">we couldn’t reliably tell if your component is a function or a class</a>, and did not allow returning <code>null</code> from it.

In the course of updating the Facebook codebase, we found a very small amount of code that was depending on the markup that React generated. Some of these cases were integration tests like WebDriver which were doing very specific XPath queries to target nodes. Others were simply tests using <code>ReactDOM.renderToStaticMarkup</code> and comparing markup. Again, there were a very small number of changes that had to be made, but we don’t want anybody to be blindsided. We encourage everybody to run their test suites when upgrading and consider alternative approaches when possible. One approach that will work for some cases is to explicitly use <code>&#x3C;span></code>s in your <code>render</code> method.  </p>\n<p><small><a href="https://github.com/mwiencek">@mwiencek</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5753">#5753</a></small></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4 id="reactcloneelement-now-resolves-defaultprops"><a href="#reactcloneelement-now-resolves-defaultprops" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a><code>React.cloneElement()</code> now resolves <code>defaultProps</code></h4>\n<p>We fixed a bug in <code>React.cloneElement()</code> that some components may rely on. If some of the <code>props</code> received by <code>cloneElement()</code> are <code>undefined</code>, it used to return an element with <code>undefined</code> values for those props. In React 15, we’re changing it to be consistent with <code>createElement()</code>. Now any <code>undefined</code> props passed to <code>cloneElement()</code> are resolved to the corresponding component’s <code>defaultProps</code>. Only one of our 20,000 React components was negatively affected by this so we feel comfortable releasing this change without keeping the old behavior for another release cycle.  </p>\n<p><small><a href="https://github.com/truongduy134">@truongduy134</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5997">#5997</a></small></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4 id="reactperfgetlastmeasurements-is-opaque"><a href="#reactperfgetlastmeasurements-is-opaque" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a><code>ReactPerf.getLastMeasurements()</code> is opaque</h4>\n<p>This change won’t affect applications but may break some third-party tools.
